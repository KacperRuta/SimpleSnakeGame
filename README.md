# Simple Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game developed in Java 21 using the Swing framework for the graphical interface. The game is played within a 600x600 pixel window, and the objective is to control the snake, collect points, and avoid collisions with walls or the snake's body.

## Features

- **Grid-based movement**: The snake moves in a fixed direction and can be controlled using the arrow keys (or WASD keys).
- **Food points**: The snake grows when it eats the food (randomly placed red points on the screen), and the player's score increases.
- **Game Over**: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body, with the final score displayed on the screen.
- **Score system**: Keeps track of the player's score based on the number of points eaten.

## Game Controls

- **Arrow keys (or WASD keys)**: Control the snake's movement.
